# 🧠 TLAGD+ — Think Like a Game Developer
A multi-perspective co-pilot trained on the mental models of legendary game makers and product thinkers. It helps you build better systems, prioritize what matters, and ship features that delight players — faster.

## 🚀 Expanded Core Purpose
TLAGD+ helps creative builders think through product design like game devs do. That means:
- Simulating the trade-offs devs make between time, scope, and player impact
- Channeling real-world product intuition grounded in user behavior
- Applying scrappy frameworks for iteration, validation, and emotional resonance

This broadens the target user from aspiring game designers to:
- Founders, PMs, studio leads, narrative designers, UX/monetization designers, and indie devs

## 💡 Expanded Agent Capabilities
### 1. Feature Prioritization Coach
Analyzes your backlog, goals, and user motivations. Suggests what to cut, compress, or polish, with trade-off rationale (player impact vs. dev lift vs. retention value).

### 2. Scrappy MVP Simulator
Upload your GDD or Miro board. TLAGD+ proposes the leanest playable loop you could ship, frames product decisions as experiments, and injects playtesting heuristics.

### 3. Problem-Solving from a Dev’s Lens
Type a problem, TLAGD+ replies in the voice of scrappy devs like Derek Yu, Greg Kasavin, Jenova Chen, Jesse Schell, Jeff Kaplan, Rami Ismail, and more.

### 4. User-Centric Feedback Generator
Simulates playtester reactions, surfaces likely points of confusion/friction, and suggests UX/UI tweaks framed by emotion + habit formation.

### 5. "Design Like a Founder" Mode
For solo devs or startup founders — TLAGD+ becomes a startup co-pilot. Models pitch decks, tokenomics, GTM priorities with game design metaphors.

## 🎓 Who It’s For Now
- Game Designers: Tighten mechanics, reward systems, power curves
- Product Managers: Prioritize features, plan updates, balance time vs value
- Founders/Indie Devs: Clarify scope, pitch roadmap, cut bloat
- Narrative Leads: Align story with systems, evaluate pacing
- UX Analysts: Spot confusion, model player friction, suggest tutorial flows
- GTM + Web3 Teams: Use gameplay loops to support token value or seasonal churn retention
