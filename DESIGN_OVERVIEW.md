# üß† TLAGD+ ‚Äî Glitter Cloud Solutions
A set of tools and AI agents channeling the mental models of legendary game makers and product thinkers. TLAGD+ helps you turn ideas into reality faster, with greater clarity, ruthless prioritization, and business alignment.

## üöÄ Expanded Core Purpose
TLAGD+ prepares founders, PMs, and teams to succeed in the new world of rapid, small-team product development. That means:
- Simulating trade-offs between time, scope, player impact, and business goals
- Surfacing actionable, OKR-mapped recommendations for every step
- Providing real-time, in-meeting guidance and editorialized feedback
- Enabling rapid iteration, ruthless MVP scoping, and pitch artifact generation

## üí° Expanded Agent Capabilities
### 1. Feature Prioritization Coach
Analyzes your backlog, goals, and user motivations. Suggests what to cut, compress, or polish, with trade-off rationale (player impact vs. dev lift vs. retention value), always mapped to OKRs.

### 2. Scrappy MVP Simulator
Upload your GDD, PRD, or pitch. TLAGD+ proposes the leanest playable loop you could ship, frames decisions as experiments, and injects playtesting heuristics‚Äîall mapped to business goals.

### 3. Problem-Solving from a Dev‚Äôs Lens
Type a problem; TLAGD+ replies in the voice of legendary devs and product minds, surfacing trade-offs, risks, and rationale tailored to your context.

### 4. User-Centric Feedback Generator
Simulates playtester reactions, surfaces likely points of confusion/friction, and suggests UX/UI tweaks framed by emotion + habit formation.

### 5. "Design Like a Founder" Mode
For solo devs or startup founders ‚Äî TLAGD+ becomes a startup co-pilot. Models pitch decks, tokenomics, GTM priorities with game design metaphors, and delivers recommendations mapped to OKRs and business viability.

### 6. Meeting & Cycle Management Agent
Joins meetings (live or async), keeps teams focused on declared OKRs, prompts for new OKRs or pivots when priorities shift, and delivers editorialized, agent-referenced summaries and recommendations. Tracks meeting time spent on OKR-aligned vs. off-topic discussions and drives accountability in real time.

## üéì Who It‚Äôs For Now
- Founders & Startup Teams: Move from idea to MVP, align every feature to business goals, and stay focused through rapid iteration.
- Product Managers: Prioritize features, plan updates, balance time vs value, and drive team accountability with OKR-aligned meetings.
- Game Designers & Indie Devs: Tighten mechanics, reward systems, and scope ruthlessly for fast launches.
- Narrative & UX Leads: Align story with systems, evaluate pacing, spot friction, and model player experience.
- Monetization & GTM Teams: Use gameplay loops to support revenue, retention, and premium features.
- Accelerators, Hackathons, and Educators: Demo multi-perspective critique, run sprints, and teach real-world product trade-offs.
