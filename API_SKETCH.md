## Integrations (Deep Dive)
- **Notion, Jira, Slack, Google Workspace:**
  - OAuth2 authentication, granular permission scopes, and webhook support for real-time updates.
  - Import/export endpoints for seamless workflow integration (e.g., auto-export meeting summaries, import Jira tickets as backlog items).
  - Monetization: Integration add-ons, premium export formats, and analytics on usage.
- **Enterprise SSO (SAML, SCIM):**
  - User provisioning, role-based access, and audit logs for compliance.
  - Supports bulk onboarding and automated deprovisioning.
- **Classroom Mode (LMS Integration):**
  - API endpoints for assessment export, student progress sync, and feedback delivery to LMS platforms (Canvas, Blackboard, Google Classroom).
  - Extensible for new LMS partners and education verticals.
- **Edge Cases:** API versioning, backward compatibility, rate limiting, and partner-specific quirks.
- **Business Impact:** Drives expansion revenue, supports enterprise and education verticals, and increases stickiness via workflow lock-in.

## Analytics & Audit
- **Endpoints:** Retrieve usage analytics, agent-attributed recommendations, compliance logs, and cohort analytics for accelerators/education partners.
- **Rationale:** Analytics drive upsell to premium tiers and provide defensible value for enterprise and education customers.
- **Usage Flow:**
  1. Admin requests usage analytics or compliance logs via dashboard or API.
  2. API returns detailed metrics, agent feedback, and exportable reports.
- **Authentication/Security:** Admin-level API tokens, audit trails, and export logs.
- **Edge Cases:** Large datasets, privacy requests (right to be forgotten), regulatory audits.
- **Business Impact:** Enables data-driven upsell, supports compliance, and increases customer retention.

## Open API, Extensibility & Rate Limiting
- **API Tokens:** User, team, and partner automation supported with granular scopes and usage analytics.
- **Webhooks:** Real-time artifact export, meeting summary delivery, risk alert notifications, and custom agent triggers.
- **Extensibility:** Partners can build custom integrations, agent modules, and analytics dashboards on top of the core API.
- **Rate Limiting:** Tiered by plan; premium/enterprise customers get higher quotas and priority support. Abuse detection and throttling built in.
- **Authentication/Security:** OAuth2, SSO, and token-based auth; all endpoints monitored and logged for compliance.
- **Business Impact:** Supports ecosystem growth, API monetization, and partner-driven expansion.
