# TLAGD+ Sample Outputs (Expanded)

## 1. Meeting Summary (Agent-Attributed)

**Context & Rationale:**
This meeting summary demonstrates how TLAGD+ agents transform routine sprint planning into actionable, investor-grade documentation. By attributing recommendations to specific agent personas, teams gain clarity on rationale, reduce ambiguity, and create a transparent audit trail for every decision. This supports both internal alignment and external reporting (e.g., for investors or board reviews).

**Summary:**
Sprint planning focused on onboarding improvements. 20% of time spent off-OKR (discussion of analytics dashboard). Team agreed to defer analytics work.

**Agent Editorials:**
- PM Agent: “Defer analytics dashboard to next cycle. Focus on onboarding flow for OKR #1.”
- Tech Lead Agent: “Unblock API integration for Feature Y to meet OKR #2.”
- UX Agent: “Add first-time user tutorial to reduce friction and improve retention.”

**Next Steps:**
- Assign onboarding tasks to relevant team members with deadlines and success metrics.
- Schedule API integration review and assign responsible owners.
- Draft user tutorial content and review with UX agent.

**Business Impact:**
- Accelerates decision-making and accountability.
- Reduces meeting bloat and increases focus on business-critical OKRs.
- Provides a repeatable, investor-friendly artifact for fundraising, due diligence, or retrospectives.

## 2. MVP Plan (OKR-Mapped)

**Context & Rationale:**
This output showcases TLAGD+’s ability to turn vague goals and raw GDDs into a laser-focused, OKR-mapped execution plan. The structure and clarity provided help teams avoid scope creep, demonstrate progress to stakeholders, and drive toward measurable outcomes.

**Input:** GDD + 90-day deadline

**Output:**
- Core Loop: Ship onboarding, core gameplay, and retention hooks in first 30 days.
- OKR #1: 1,000 users complete onboarding (measurable, time-bound goal).
- OKR #2: 30% retention after 14 days (industry benchmark for product-market fit).
- Experiment: A/B test tutorial variants to optimize onboarding effectiveness.

**User Journey:**
1. Founder uploads GDD and sets timeline.
2. TLAGD+ agents extract core loops, map to OKRs, and propose a phased execution plan.
3. Team receives a ready-to-execute roadmap and can export to Notion, Jira, or share with investors.

**Business Impact:**

- Demonstrates data-driven execution to investors, improving funding odds.
- Enables rapid iteration and learning, supporting a culture of experimentation.

## 3. Persona Battle Critique

**Context & Rationale:**
The persona battle showcases how TLAGD+ delivers multi-perspective, expert-level critique on any artifact. By simulating feedback from legendary designers, teams get actionable, diverse insights that would otherwise require expensive consultants or years of experience.

**Derek Yu:** “Cut recipes by 50%. Focus on replayability and mastery.”
**Greg Kasavin:** “Tie crafting to narrative beats for emotional resonance.”
**TLAGD+ Insight:** “Both suggestions align with OKR #2: Improve player retention.”

**Strategic Explanation:**
- Contrasting feedback surfaces trade-offs and encourages creative problem-solving.
- Mapping all suggestions to explicit OKRs ensures every recommendation is actionable and measurable.
- This format is highly shareable and can be used in investor updates, design reviews, or community showcases.

**Business Impact:**
- Drives better product decisions and faster learning cycles.
- Differentiates TLAGD+ from generic AI tools by providing domain-specific, persona-driven critique.
