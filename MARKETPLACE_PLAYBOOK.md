# TLAGD+ Custom Agent & Persona Marketplace Playbook

---

## Marketplace Vision & Rationale
- **Goal:** Enable users, partners, and third-party experts to create, publish, and monetize custom agents, personas, critique templates, and integrations.
- **Strategic Rationale:** A thriving marketplace increases platform stickiness, unlocks new revenue streams (revenue share, listing fees, premium placement), and drives innovation from the community.
- **Business Impact:** Supports long-tail use cases, attracts domain experts, and creates a defensible ecosystem moat.

## Marketplace Structure
- **Categories:**
  - Custom personas (e.g., “Investor Mode,” “Indie Game Critic,” “Educator Mentor”)
  - Agent modules (e.g., “Compliance Reviewer,” “Monetization Expert”)
  - Critique templates (e.g., “Pitch Deck Review,” “Classroom Assessment”)
  - Integrations (e.g., LMS, analytics, niche PM tools)
- **Submission Flow:**
  1. User/partner creates agent/persona/template via guided builder.
  2. Submits for review (automated checks + human moderation).
  3. Option to set price (free, one-time, subscription, usage-based) and revenue share.
  4. Listing appears in marketplace with screenshots, demo videos, and reviews.
- **Discovery:**
  - Search, filter, and featured listings; trending and new releases; personalized recommendations.

## Governance & Monetization
- **Moderation:** Automated review for compliance, quality, and IP; community flagging; human review for edge cases.
- **Revenue Share:** Standard split (e.g., 70/30), with premium placement and featured listing options.
- **Partner Tiers:** Certified partners, agency listings, and enterprise integrations with white-labeling.
- **Analytics:** Dashboard for creators to track installs, usage, revenue, and reviews.

## Extensibility & API
- **Open API:** Partners can build and publish integrations, agent modules, and analytics dashboards.
- **Versioning:** Support for updating, deprecating, and forking listings.
- **Security:** All marketplace modules sandboxed and reviewed for security/privacy compliance.

## Example Use Cases
- **Indie Dev:** Publishes a “Narrative Critic” persona, earns revenue from downloads and subscriptions.
- **Enterprise Partner:** Offers a compliance agent module, bundles with consulting services.
- **Educator:** Shares classroom assessment templates, builds reputation and community following.

## Marketplace Roadmap
- **MVP:** Persona/agent builder, listing, and basic moderation.
- **V1:** Monetization, analytics, partner tiers, and API publishing.
- **V2:** Advanced discovery, premium placement, community voting, and white-labeling.
