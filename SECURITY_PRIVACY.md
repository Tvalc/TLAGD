## Security Overview
- **SOC2, GDPR, FERPA Ready:** All infrastructure and data flows are designed for compliance with major enterprise and education standards.
- **Data Encryption:** All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256). Sensitive user data is never stored longer than necessary.
- **Access Controls:** Role-based access, SSO (SAML/SCIM), and audit logs for all admin and agent actions. Least-privilege by default.
- **Penetration Testing:** Regular third-party security audits and bug bounty program.
- **Incident Response:** 24/7 monitoring, rapid breach notification, and disaster recovery plans.

## Privacy & Data Handling
- **User Control:** Users can export, delete, or anonymize all data (right to be forgotten) via self-serve dashboard or API.
- **Data Residency:** EU/US data center options for enterprise/education customers.
- **Consent & Transparency:** Clear consent for data use, integrations, and agent participation. Privacy policy reviewed annually.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** All integrations (Notion, Jira, Slack, Google, LMS) require explicit OAuth consent and granular permission scopes.

## Compliance Features
