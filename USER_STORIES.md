# TLAGD+ User Stories

## 1. Product Manager / Founder
- As a PM, I want to upload my feature backlog and get prioritized recommendations with rationale (impact vs. dev cost), so I can make better roadmap decisions.
- As a founder, I want TLAGD+ to simulate a 90-day MVP plan from my GDD, so I can scope realistically and impress stakeholders.

## 2. UX / Narrative / Monetization Designer
- As a UX lead, I want to get simulated playtester feedback on my onboarding flow, so I can spot friction and improve retention.
- As a narrative designer, I want to see how different legendary devs would critique my story pacing, so I can align narrative with gameplay.
- As a monetization designer, I want advice on balancing progression and premium features, so I can maximize LTV without hurting player trust.

## 3. Studio Lead / Team
- As a studio lead, I want to run our roadmap through TLAGD+ to identify bloat and cut features that won’t move the needle.
- As a producer, I want to integrate TLAGD+ into our Discord for quick backlog critique and team debates on scope.

## 4. Solo / Indie Dev
- As a solo dev, I want to get “founder mode” feedback on my pitch deck and tokenomics, so I can refine my GTM and raise funds.
- As an indie, I want to ask, “What would Derek Yu or Greg Kasavin cut from my crafting system?” and compare perspectives.

## 5. Content Creator / Educator
- As an instructor, I want to demo multi-perspective design critique in class, so students learn real-world product trade-offs.
- As a YouTuber, I want to post “Persona Battle” threads showing how different AI devs would fix a broken system.
