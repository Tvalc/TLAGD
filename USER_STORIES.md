# TLAGD+ User Stories (Glitter Cloud Solutions)

## 1. Product Manager / Founder
- As a PM, I want to upload my feature backlog and get prioritized, OKR-mapped recommendations with rationale (impact vs. dev cost), so I can make better roadmap decisions and align my team.
- As a founder, I want TLAGD+ to simulate a 90-day MVP plan from my GDD, with each feature mapped to a business goal, so I can scope realistically and impress stakeholders.
- As a founder, I want TLAGD+ to join my sprint planning meetings, prompt the team to stay focused on declared OKRs, and summarize the meeting with actionable, agent-attributed recommendations.
- As a founder, I want to receive post-meeting summaries that editorialize the discussion, attribute recommendations to specific agents (e.g., PM Agent, Tech Lead Agent), and highlight which OKRs are at risk or need updating.

## 2. UX / Narrative / Monetization Designer
- As a UX lead, I want to get simulated playtester feedback on my onboarding flow, with actionable suggestions for improving retention and user confidence metrics.
- As a narrative designer, I want to see how different legendary devs would critique my story pacing, so I can align narrative with gameplay and ensure emotional resonance.
- As a monetization designer, I want advice on balancing progression and premium features, with recommendations tied to ARPU and retention OKRs, so I can maximize LTV without hurting player trust.
- As a designer, I want to review meeting summaries that highlight UX or monetization risks surfaced by the relevant agent, so I can address them proactively in the next cycle.

## 3. Studio Lead / Team
- As a studio lead, I want to run our roadmap through TLAGD+ to identify bloat, cut features that won’t move the needle, and see all recommendations mapped to our team’s OKRs.
- As a producer, I want to integrate TLAGD+ into our Discord for quick backlog critique, team debates on scope, and instant meeting summaries that drive accountability.
- As a team, we want TLAGD+ to prompt us when meetings drift from declared OKRs, and to suggest when a new OKR should be created for a recurring topic.

## 4. Solo / Indie Dev
- As a solo dev, I want to get “founder mode” feedback on my pitch deck and tokenomics, with actionable suggestions for business viability and investor appeal.
- As an indie, I want to ask, “What would Derek Yu or Greg Kasavin cut from my crafting system?” and compare perspectives, with each critique mapped to a clear rationale and business goal.
- As a solo dev, I want to see how my decisions and iterations impact key metrics (e.g., time to export, repeat usage, referral rate) over time.

## 5. Content Creator / Educator
- As an instructor, I want to demo multi-perspective design critique in class, so students learn real-world product trade-offs and see how agent recommendations map to business outcomes.
- As a YouTuber, I want to post “Persona Battle” threads showing how different AI devs would fix a broken system, with each solution mapped to OKRs and success metrics.

## 6. Edge Cases & Meeting/Cycle Management
- As a team, we want TLAGD+ to flag when a meeting spends more than 20% of time on topics not mapped to any OKR, so we can refocus or create new objectives.
- As a PM, I want to see a dashboard of all agent-attributed recommendations from the last month, grouped by OKR and business impact.
- As a founder, I want to receive a summary when an MVP scope or feature is at risk of missing its OKR, with recommendations for course correction from the relevant agent.
