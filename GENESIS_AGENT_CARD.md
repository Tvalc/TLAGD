# TLAGD+ — Genesis Agent Card (Glitter Cloud Solutions)

## 🧠 What is TLAGD+?
A set of AI tools and agents channeling the mental models of legendary game makers and product thinkers. TLAGD+ helps founders, teams, and creative builders:
- Prioritize features, cut bloat, and align every decision to explicit OKRs
- Simulate MVPs and playtest loops, always mapped to business goals
- Get feedback and critique from "scrappy dev" personas and iconic voices
- Ship products that delight users and drive business outcomes—faster
- Stay focused and accountable in meetings and development cycles

## 🚀 Who is it for?
- Founders, product managers, and studio leads
- UX, narrative, and monetization designers
- Indie devs, web3 teams, and accelerators
- Content creators and educators
- Any team or solo builder aiming for rapid, outcome-driven product development

## 💡 Core Capabilities
- **Feature Prioritization Coach:** Upload your backlog, get trade-off recommendations mapped to OKRs and business value
- **MVP Simulator:** Generate lean, testable product plans and experiments, always tied to measurable outcomes
- **Multi-Perspective Critique:** Ask for feedback from legendary devs (Derek Yu, Greg Kasavin, Jenova Chen, etc.) or blend perspectives for a multi-voiced critique
- **User-Centric Feedback:** Simulate playtester reactions, spot friction, and receive actionable UX/UI suggestions
- **Founder Mode:** Rewrite decks and whitepapers with viral hooks, game design metaphors, and explicit business rationale
- **Meeting & Cycle Management Agent:** Join meetings (live or async), keep teams focused on declared OKRs, prompt for new OKRs when priorities shift, and deliver editorialized, agent-referenced summaries and recommendations. Tracks meeting time spent on OKR-aligned vs. off-topic discussions and drives accountability in real time.

## 🧩 Agent Taxonomy & Interactions
- **PM Agent:** Drives prioritization, roadmap focus, and OKR alignment
- **Tech Lead Agent:** Surfaces technical risks, trade-offs, and unblockers
- **UX Agent:** Spots friction, onboarding issues, and retention risks
- **Founder/Investor Agent:** Pushes for business viability, narrative, and pitch clarity
- **Meeting Agent:** Orchestrates the above, editorializes meeting summaries, and ensures every recommendation is attributed, rationale is clear, and outputs are actionable

## 🌟 Example Use Cases
- **Sprint Planning:** TLAGD+ joins your meeting, prompts when discussion drifts from OKRs, and delivers a summary with agent-referenced recommendations (e.g., “Tech Lead Agent recommends unblocking Feature Y for OKR #2.”)
- **Roadmap Review:** Upload your backlog and get a prioritized, OKR-mapped plan with rationale from multiple agent perspectives
- **Pitch Prep:** Founder Mode rewrites your deck, surfaces viral hooks, and ties every claim to business goals
