## Press Release (For Immediate Release)

**Glitter Cloud Solutions Launches TLAGD+: The First AI Product Co-Pilot That Plans, Guides, and Drives Execution for Founders and Teams**

Seattle, WA — May 28, 2025 — Glitter Cloud Solutions is proud to announce the launch of TLAGD+ (Think Like a Game Developer Plus), the world’s first AI-powered product co-pilot that takes you from raw idea to fundable MVP—and now, keeps your team focused and aligned from kickoff to launch.

**TLAGD+ isn’t just a planning tool. It’s your always-on product strategist, technical advisor, pitch coach, and meeting facilitator—all in one.**

> “We built TLAGD+ because we’ve lived the pain of turning big ideas into real products—and watched too many teams lose focus or stall out after the first plan,” said [Product Owner Name], Product Owner of TLAGD+. “Now, TLAGD+ doesn’t just help you plan; it sits in your meetings, keeps everyone focused on what matters, and editorializes every session with actionable, agent-driven recommendations.”

**Key Features:**
- **Zero-to-One Planning, Accelerated:** Paste a napkin sketch, voice note, or messy doc—TLAGD+ extracts your vision, aligns with business goals, scopes a fundable MVP, and generates pitch-ready artifacts in under an hour.
- **Meeting & Cycle Management Agent:** TLAGD+ joins your meetings (live or async), surfaces when discussion drifts from declared OKRs, prompts for new OKRs when priorities shift, and delivers editorialized summaries with recommendations from its suite of Developer Agents (e.g., PM Agent, Tech Lead Agent).
- **Founder-Centric, Always-On:** Get feedback in the voice of legendary founders, ruthless MVP scoping, and outputs mapped to your goals—not just generic “best practices.”
- **Export-Ready Artifacts:** Instantly generate PRDs, GDDs, pitch decks, and one-pagers, ready for investors, teams, or accelerators.
- **Integrations:** Export to PDF, Notion, Google Slides, and more. APIs for Jira, Slack, and additional platforms coming soon.

**Why Now?**

The zero-to-one phase is broken. Most AI tools offer code or generic advice, but none can:
- Digest messy, unstructured ideas
- Map every feature to a business goal or OKR
- Guide real-time meetings and sprints, keeping teams focused and accountable
- Editorialize and recommend next steps with agent-referenced insights

**TLAGD+ closes this gap—empowering founders and teams to move from inspiration to execution, and from execution to launch, with unprecedented speed and clarity.**

**Availability**

TLAGD+ is available now for early access. To learn more, schedule a demo, or join the waitlist, visit [website link].

## 2. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What is TLAGD+?**
A: TLAGD+ is an AI-powered product and game design co-pilot that takes any idea—no matter how raw or unstructured—and delivers a clear, actionable product requirements doc (PRD/GDD), a ruthlessly scoped MVP plan, and a pitch artifact ready for investors or team recruitment. It also provides critique in the voice of legendary product minds, ensuring every recommendation is specific, actionable, and tied to your business goals.

**Q: Who is TLAGD+ for?**
A: TLAGD+ is built for:
- Startup founders (especially solo or technical founders who need to move fast)
- Indie game developers and small studios
- Product managers at early-stage or lean companies
- Accelerators, incubators, and hackathon teams
- Anyone with a big idea and limited time/resources who needs to go from zero to one quickly

**Q: How does TLAGD+ actually work? Can you walk me through a typical workflow?**
A: Absolutely. Here’s a step-by-step example of how a founder uses TLAGD+:
1. **Onboarding:** The founder lands on the TLAGD+ dashboard, is greeted with a short intro, and prompted to paste their idea (free-form, doc, or voice note). Example copy: _"Paste your wildest idea, napkin sketch, or PRD draft below. We’ll handle the rest."_
2. **Essence Extraction:** TLAGD+ parses the input, asks clarifying questions (e.g., "Who is your target user? What’s the core loop? What’s your business goal?") via a chat interface or form.
3. **Persona Mode (Optional):** The founder can choose to receive feedback in the voice of a legendary dev (e.g., Sid Meier, Shigeru Miyamoto, or a scrappy indie founder).
4. **GDD/PRD Drafting:** TLAGD+ generates a structured requirements doc, extracting goals, audience, differentiators, and risks. The founder can edit, comment, or iterate in real time.
5. **MVP Scoping:** The agent identifies the smallest testable product slice, mapping each feature to user-defined OKRs. Example output: _"To validate your core loop and audience, build only X, Y, and Z for your MVP. Here’s why…"_
6. **Pitch Artifact Generation:** TLAGD+ produces a one-pager or deck outline tailored for fundraising or recruiting. All content is exportable to PDF, Google Slides, or Notion.
7. **Iteration:** The founder can request critique, roadmap suggestions, or deck rewrites, and TLAGD+ will update outputs accordingly.

**Q: What kinds of input does TLAGD+ accept?**
A: TLAGD+ is flexible by design. It accepts:
- Free-form text (from napkin sketches to detailed PRDs)

### Metric Definitions & Calculation Logic
- **Session Completion:** A session is counted as "complete" if user reaches the export/share step.
- **NPS:** Standard 0-10 scale, calculated quarterly. Promoters minus detractors.
- **OKR Mapping:** All MVP scope tables must have OKR column populated; enforced by UI logic.
- **Repeat Usage:** Unique user IDs with >1 session in 90 days.
- **Referral:** User enters referral code or sends invite; tracked in-app.
- **MRR:** Sum of all active paid subscriptions and usage fees per month.
- **Paid Conversion:** (# paid users / # free users) over a rolling 30-day window.
- **ARPU:** Total revenue / total active users (monthly).
- **Paid Mentor Sessions:** Count of unique paid mentor/expert bookings.
- **Premium Export Purchases:** Count/% of users purchasing premium downloads/integrations.

### How Metrics Drive Product Iteration & Business Strategy
- **Weekly Review:** Product/engineering/design review dashboard weekly; OKRs updated quarterly.
- **Revenue Review:** Monetization metrics reviewed monthly with leadership; pricing/feature experiments prioritized based on trends.
- **User Feedback Loop:** In-app surveys and interviews drive roadmap prioritization.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** All metrics are visible to founders, investors, and team. Any metric below target triggers a root-cause analysis and action plan.

### Business Impact Commentary
- **Revenue and conversion metrics** are leading indicators of business viability and investor interest.
- **Time-to-plan** and **confidence** are leading indicators of founder success and downstream MVP launches.
- **Referral and repeat usage** are proxies for product-market fit.
- **MVPs launched/funded** is the ultimate proof of value—this is our "north star."

## 8. Non-Goals / Out of Scope
- Grant funding aggregation and application automation
- "One click to post my game all over the internet" (distribution automation)
- Automated grant writing or submission to third-party funding platforms
- Full social media and PR blast automation
- End-to-end publishing or launch workflow (beyond MVP planning and pitch artifact)
- Ongoing project management (beyond MVP planning)
- Deep market research (beyond basic competitor mapping)

## 9. Risks & Assumptions
- Users may expect "magic"—need to set clear expectations on scope and AI limits
- Quality of output depends on clarity of input; onboarding and prompt design are critical
- Competitive pressure from generic AI tools (Cursor, Notion, etc.)
- Differentiation relies on founder-centric voice, speed, and actionable outputs
- Must balance flexibility (free-form input) with structure (usable docs)

## 10. Appendix

### 10.1. Personas
- **The Scrappy Solo Founder**
  - *Profile:* Solo indie dev, limited time/budget, focused on rapid prototyping.
  - *Quote:* “I have a wild idea and a week off—what’s the fastest path to a playable demo and pitch?”
  - *Needs:* Ruthless scoping, instant feedback, investor-ready docs.
- **The Veteran PM**
  - *Profile:* Experienced product manager, needs to align team and execs quickly.
  - *Quote:* “I want to ensure our MVP plan aligns with business OKRs and is defensible to leadership.”
  - *Needs:* OKR mapping, risk analysis, exportable docs.
- **The Indie Studio Lead**
  - *Profile:* Small team leader, juggling creative vision and resource constraints.
  - *Quote:* “How do I turn our brainstorm into a plan my team can actually execute?”
  - *Needs:* Team collaboration, trade-off tables, persona critique.
- **The Accelerator Mentor**
  - *Profile:* Runs a cohort, wants all teams to reach MVP/fundable stage fast.
  - *Quote:* “Can my cohort teams all get to a fundable MVP using TLAGD+?”
  - *Needs:* Repeatable workflow, exportable artifacts, mentor review mode.

### 10.2. Example User Stories (with Acceptance Criteria)
- *As a founder, I want to turn my raw idea into a fundable MVP plan in under an hour, so that I can pitch investors this week.*
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - User completes onboarding in <10 min
    - Receives GDD/PRD draft and MVP scope within 1 hour
    - Can export pitch artifact
- *As an indie dev, I want to get actionable feedback on my GDD before pitching investors, so that my plan is defensible.*
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Receives persona-based critique
    - Risk table and OKR mapping included in output
- *As a PM, I want to ensure my MVP plan aligns with our business OKRs, so that leadership signs off.*
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Every feature in MVP scope is mapped to at least one OKR
    - Rationale for each scope decision is explicit

### 10.3. Glossary & Acronyms
- **GDD:** Game Design Document
- **PRD:** Product Requirements Document
- **MVP:** Minimum Viable Product
- **OKR:** Objective & Key Result
- **Persona Mode:** Feedback in the voice of a legendary dev, PM, or investor
- **Scope Table:** Table mapping features to rationale, OKRs, and cuttable status
- **Pitch Artifact:** One-pager or deck draft for fundraising/recruiting

### 10.4. Example Inputs & Outputs
- **Input:**
  - “A cozy farming sim where the crops are NFTs and players vote on weather events.”
  - “A mobile puzzle game that teaches basic coding skills to kids.”
  - “A SaaS tool for remote tabletop RPG campaigns with AI-powered NPCs.”
- **Output (for first input):**
  - *GDD Draft:* Vision, Problem, Audience, Core Loop, Features (farming, NFT minting, voting system), Risks, Differentiators
  - *MVP Scope Table:* Core farming loop (must-have), NFT minting (cuttable), voting system (cuttable)
  - *Pitch One-Pager:* Vision, Problem, Solution, Market, MVP, Team, Ask (Web3 investors)
  - *Persona Critique:* “As a Web3 investor, I’d want to see traction on the core loop before NFT integration.”

### 10.7. Sample Meeting Summary & Editorialization (Cycle Management Agent)
**Meeting:** Sprint Planning – May 28, 2025
**Attendees:** Product, Engineering, Design, TLAGD+ Agent

**Summary:**
- Discussed Feature X (not tied to current OKRs)
- Identified blockers for Feature Y (OKR #2: Ship MVP by June 1)
- Debated adding new analytics dashboard

**Agent Editorial & Recommendations:**
- *PM Agent:* “Recommend deferring Feature X until a new OKR is declared; current discussion is drifting from declared objectives.”
- *Tech Lead Agent:* “Suggest unblocking Feature Y by allocating 2 more dev days; this is critical for OKR #2.”
- *TLAGD+ Insight:* “Team spent 20% of meeting on topics outside current OKRs. Consider a new OKR for analytics if business value is validated.”

**Next Steps:**
- Revisit OKRs in next meeting
- Assign action items to unblock Feature Y
- Decide on analytics dashboard OKR

### 10.5. Edge Cases & Special Scenarios
- **Edge Case:** User submits only a vague idea (“Make a fun game for kids”)
  - *System Response:* TLAGD+ prompts for more detail, offers examples, and guides user through clarifying questions.
- **Edge Case:** User wants to skip persona mode
  - *System Response:* Defaults to “founder voice” critique, but allows opt-in later.
- **Edge Case:** Team collaboration needed
  - *System Response:* User can invite collaborators, assign comments/tasks, and version outputs.

### 10.6. Example Success Metrics (Expanded)
- **Time to first MVP plan:** Median minutes from onboarding to export
- **% of users generating pitch artifacts:** Export/download logs
- **NPS and qualitative feedback:** Quarterly surveys, in-app prompts
- **Number of MVPs launched/funded:** User self-report, follow-up interviews
- **Referral and repeat usage rates:** In-app tracking, unique user IDs

---
**If TLAGD+ fails to deliver on this vision, generic AI tools will dominate the zero-to-one space, and Windsurf will lose its edge to Cursor and others.**
