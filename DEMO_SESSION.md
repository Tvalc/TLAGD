# TLAGD+ Demo Session (Glitter Cloud Solutions)

## Scenario: Product Manager Uploads a Feature Backlog for Prioritization

**User (PM):**
Hey TLAGD+, here’s our current feature backlog for our co-op roguelike:
- New crafting system
- Social hub with emotes
- Weekly challenge mode
- Tutorial overhaul
- PvP arena
- Cosmetic shop
- Fishing minigame
Our goal: maximize player retention and DAU for the next 90 days, but we have limited dev bandwidth.

**TLAGD+ (Feature Prioritization Coach):**
Analyzing your backlog and goals...

**Prioritized Recommendations:**
1. **Weekly challenge mode** — High retention lift, repeatable content, fits DAU goal. Prioritize!
	* **Rationale:** Weekly challenges create a sense of urgency and encourage players to return regularly, driving up DAU and retention.
	* **Step-by-Step Flow:**
		1. Design a challenge framework with varying difficulty levels and rewards.
		2. Implement a scheduling system to ensure consistent challenge releases.
		3. Monitor player engagement and adjust challenge difficulty and rewards accordingly.
	* **Edge Cases:** Handling player complaints about challenge difficulty, ensuring challenges are accessible to new players.
	* **Expected Results:** Increased player engagement, improved retention, and a boost in DAU.
	* **Business Goal:** Drive revenue through in-game purchases and advertising.
2. **Tutorial overhaul** — Early friction kills retention; fix onboarding before adding new features.
	* **Rationale:** A well-designed tutorial sets the tone for the player's experience, reducing friction and increasing the chances of retention.
	* **Step-by-Step Flow:**
		1. Identify pain points in the current tutorial and gather player feedback.
		2. Design a new tutorial that introduces core mechanics in a engaging and intuitive way.
		3. Implement a tutorial analytics system to track player progress and identify areas for improvement.
	* **Edge Cases:** Handling players who skip the tutorial, ensuring the tutorial is accessible to players with disabilities.
	* **Expected Results:** Improved player retention, reduced frustration, and increased overall satisfaction.
	* **Business Goal:** Increase player engagement and drive revenue through in-game purchases.
3. **Social hub with emotes** — Medium dev lift, but boosts community and session length.
	* **Rationale:** A social hub with emotes encourages players to interact with each other, building a sense of community and increasing session length.
	* **Step-by-Step Flow:**
		1. Design a social hub that allows players to interact with each other in a meaningful way.
		2. Implement a system for players to create and share custom emotes.
		3. Monitor player engagement and adjust the social hub and emote system accordingly.
	* **Edge Cases:** Handling toxic player behavior, ensuring the social hub is accessible to players with disabilities.
	* **Expected Results:** Increased player engagement, improved community building, and increased session length.
	* **Business Goal:** Drive revenue through in-game purchases and increase player retention.
4. **Cosmetic shop** — Monetization, but only after core retention is stable.
	* **Rationale:** A cosmetic shop provides a revenue stream, but should only be implemented after core retention is stable to avoid distracting from the core game experience.
	* **Step-by-Step Flow:**
		1. Design a cosmetic shop that offers a variety of items that appeal to players.
		2. Implement a system for players to purchase and equip cosmetic items.
		3. Monitor player engagement and adjust the cosmetic shop accordingly.
	* **Edge Cases:** Handling player complaints about microtransactions, ensuring the cosmetic shop is accessible to players with disabilities.
	* **Expected Results:** Increased revenue, improved player satisfaction, and increased player retention.
	* **Business Goal:** Drive revenue through in-game purchases and increase player retention.
5. **PvP arena** — High dev cost, risky for retention unless core PvE is sticky.
	* **Rationale:** A PvP arena is a high-risk feature that requires significant development resources and may not pay off unless the core PvE experience is engaging.
	* **Step-by-Step Flow:**
		1. Design a PvP arena that offers a unique and engaging experience.
		2. Implement a system for players to participate in PvP matches.
		3. Monitor player engagement and adjust the PvP arena accordingly.
	* **Edge Cases:** Handling player complaints about PvP balance, ensuring the PvP arena is accessible to players with disabilities.
	* **Expected Results:** Increased player engagement, improved community building, and increased revenue.
	* **Business Goal:** Drive revenue through in-game purchases and increase player retention.
6. **Fishing minigame** — Fun, but low impact on retention.
	* **Rationale:** A fishing minigame is a low-impact feature that may not significantly impact retention, but can still provide a fun and engaging experience for players.
	* **Step-by-Step Flow:**
		1. Design a fishing minigame that is fun and engaging.
		2. Implement a system for players to participate in the fishing minigame.
		3. Monitor player engagement and adjust the fishing minigame accordingly.
	* **Edge Cases:** Handling player complaints about minigame difficulty, ensuring the minigame is accessible to players with disabilities.
	* **Expected Results:** Improved player satisfaction, increased player engagement, and increased revenue.
	* **Business Goal:** Drive revenue through in-game purchases and increase player retention.
7. **New crafting system** — High dev cost, unclear retention impact. Consider delaying or scoping down.
	* **Rationale:** A new crafting system is a high-risk feature that requires significant development resources and may not have a clear impact on retention.
	* **Step-by-Step Flow:**
		1. Design a new crafting system that offers a unique and engaging experience.
		2. Implement a system for players to craft items.
		3. Monitor player engagement and adjust the crafting system accordingly.
	* **Edge Cases:** Handling player complaints about crafting complexity, ensuring the crafting system is accessible to players with disabilities.
	* **Expected Results:** Increased player engagement, improved community building, and increased revenue.
	* **Business Goal:** Drive revenue through in-game purchases and increase player retention.

**Rationale:**
- Focus on features that drive repeat sessions and reduce churn.
- Delay high-cost, low-impact features (fishing, crafting) until core loops are proven.
- Prioritize onboarding and social glue before expanding content breadth.

- Review OKRs
- Discuss analytics dashboard
- Address blockers for Feature Y

**TLAGD+ (Meeting Agent):**
- Joined meeting as facilitator.
- Monitoring discussion topics and declared OKRs.

**During Meeting:**
- **TLAGD+ prompts:** “Current discussion on analytics dashboard is not mapped to any declared OKR. Would you like to create or update an OKR for this?”
- **Team:** “Let’s add an OKR for analytics if it aligns with business goals.”

**After Meeting:**
**TLAGD+ Meeting Summary:**
- Reviewed OKRs
- Discussed analytics dashboard (no current OKR; team to consider adding one)
- Identified blockers for Feature Y (OKR #2: Ship MVP by June 1)

**Agent Editorial & Recommendations:**
- *PM Agent:* “Recommend deferring analytics dashboard until a clear OKR is set.”
- *Tech Lead Agent:* “Suggest unblocking Feature Y by allocating 2 more dev days; this is critical for OKR #2.”
- *TLAGD+ Insight:* “20% of meeting time was spent on topics outside current OKRs. Consider formalizing an OKR for analytics if business value is validated.”

**Next Steps:**
- Revisit OKRs in next meeting
- Assign action items to unblock Feature Y
- Decide on analytics dashboard OKR

## Scenario: Indie Dev Asks for Multi-Perspective Critique

**User (Indie):**
My crafting system feels bloated and players aren’t engaging. What would Derek Yu and Greg Kasavin suggest?

**TLAGD+ (Derek Yu):**
"Cut friction to the bone. Ask: does every crafting step create discovery or just busywork? Try stripping it back to a single resource or recipe and see if it’s still fun. Replayability comes from surprise, not complexity."

**TLAGD+ (Greg Kasavin):**
"Tie crafting to narrative moments. Let players unlock recipes through story progression or character bonds. If crafting isn’t advancing the player’s sense of agency or world-building, it’s just noise."

## Scenario: Founder Uses "Design Like a Founder" Mode

**User (Founder):**
Here’s my whitepaper for a new web3 RPG. Can you rewrite it like a game trailer and suggest a viral hook?

**TLAGD+ (Founder Mode Copilot):**
"Step into a world where every quest is a DAO, every relic is a token, and your legend is minted on-chain. TLAGD+ recommends: run a 30-day community event where players co-design the first legendary artifact—winner gets a % of all future trades."

## Scenario: UX Lead Simulates Playtester Feedback

**User (UX Lead):**
How will new players feel about our onboarding flow?

**TLAGD+ (User-Centric Feedback Generator):**
"First-time players are likely to bounce at the 3rd dialog pop-up. Consider replacing text walls with interactive tooltips. Reward exploration early—habit formation starts in the first 5 minutes."

## Scenario: Content Creator Runs Persona Battle

**User (YouTuber):**
Let’s pit Jesse Schell vs. Jenova Chen on our new progression system!

**TLAGD+ (Jesse Schell):**
"Does each level-up create a memorable moment? If not, add a twist or player choice at each milestone."

**TLAGD+ (Jenova Chen):**
"Progression should feel like an emotional journey, not just a number. Use music and visual cues to make each achievement resonate."
