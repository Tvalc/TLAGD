# TLAGD+ Demo Session (Glitter Cloud Solutions)

## Scenario: Product Manager Uploads a Feature Backlog for Prioritization

**User (PM):**
Hey TLAGD+, here’s our current feature backlog for our co-op roguelike:
- New crafting system
- Social hub with emotes
- Weekly challenge mode
- Tutorial overhaul
- PvP arena
- Cosmetic shop
- Fishing minigame
Our goal: maximize player retention and DAU for the next 90 days, but we have limited dev bandwidth.

**TLAGD+ (Feature Prioritization Coach):**
Analyzing your backlog and goals...

**Prioritized Recommendations:**
1. **Weekly challenge mode** — High retention lift, repeatable content, fits DAU goal. Prioritize!
2. **Tutorial overhaul** — Early friction kills retention; fix onboarding before adding new features.
3. **Social hub with emotes** — Medium dev lift, but boosts community and session length.
4. **Cosmetic shop** — Monetization, but only after core retention is stable.
5. **PvP arena** — High dev cost, risky for retention unless core PvE is sticky.
6. **Fishing minigame** — Fun, but low impact on retention. Defer.
7. **New crafting system** — High dev cost, unclear retention impact. Consider delaying or scoping down.

**Rationale:**
- Focus on features that drive repeat sessions and reduce churn.
- Delay high-cost, low-impact features (fishing, crafting) until core loops are proven.
- Prioritize onboarding and social glue before expanding content breadth.

## Scenario: TLAGD+ Joins a Sprint Planning Meeting (Meeting & Cycle Management Agent)

**User (Team):**
We’re starting our sprint planning. Here’s our agenda:
- Review OKRs
- Discuss analytics dashboard
- Address blockers for Feature Y

**TLAGD+ (Meeting Agent):**
- Joined meeting as facilitator.
- Monitoring discussion topics and declared OKRs.

**During Meeting:**
- **TLAGD+ prompts:** “Current discussion on analytics dashboard is not mapped to any declared OKR. Would you like to create or update an OKR for this?”
- **Team:** “Let’s add an OKR for analytics if it aligns with business goals.”

**After Meeting:**
**TLAGD+ Meeting Summary:**
- Reviewed OKRs
- Discussed analytics dashboard (no current OKR; team to consider adding one)
- Identified blockers for Feature Y (OKR #2: Ship MVP by June 1)

**Agent Editorial & Recommendations:**
- *PM Agent:* “Recommend deferring analytics dashboard until a clear OKR is set.”
- *Tech Lead Agent:* “Suggest unblocking Feature Y by allocating 2 more dev days; this is critical for OKR #2.”
- *TLAGD+ Insight:* “20% of meeting time was spent on topics outside current OKRs. Consider formalizing an OKR for analytics if business value is validated.”

**Next Steps:**
- Revisit OKRs in next meeting
- Assign action items to unblock Feature Y
- Decide on analytics dashboard OKR

## Scenario: Indie Dev Asks for Multi-Perspective Critique

**User (Indie):**
My crafting system feels bloated and players aren’t engaging. What would Derek Yu and Greg Kasavin suggest?

**TLAGD+ (Derek Yu):**
"Cut friction to the bone. Ask: does every crafting step create discovery or just busywork? Try stripping it back to a single resource or recipe and see if it’s still fun. Replayability comes from surprise, not complexity."

**TLAGD+ (Greg Kasavin):**
"Tie crafting to narrative moments. Let players unlock recipes through story progression or character bonds. If crafting isn’t advancing the player’s sense of agency or world-building, it’s just noise."

## Scenario: Founder Uses "Design Like a Founder" Mode

**User (Founder):**
Here’s my whitepaper for a new web3 RPG. Can you rewrite it like a game trailer and suggest a viral hook?

**TLAGD+ (Founder Mode Copilot):**
"Step into a world where every quest is a DAO, every relic is a token, and your legend is minted on-chain. TLAGD+ recommends: run a 30-day community event where players co-design the first legendary artifact—winner gets a % of all future trades."

## Scenario: UX Lead Simulates Playtester Feedback

**User (UX Lead):**
How will new players feel about our onboarding flow?

**TLAGD+ (User-Centric Feedback Generator):**
"First-time players are likely to bounce at the 3rd dialog pop-up. Consider replacing text walls with interactive tooltips. Reward exploration early—habit formation starts in the first 5 minutes."

## Scenario: Content Creator Runs Persona Battle

**User (YouTuber):**
Let’s pit Jesse Schell vs. Jenova Chen on our new progression system!

**TLAGD+ (Jesse Schell):**
"Does each level-up create a memorable moment? If not, add a twist or player choice at each milestone."

**TLAGD+ (Jenova Chen):**
"Progression should feel like an emotional journey, not just a number. Use music and visual cues to make each achievement resonate."
