# Think Like a Game Designer (TLAGD)

A conversational AI co-pilot that channels the minds of the world’s best game designers to help you design better games, faster.

## Vision
- Simulate design sessions with legendary designers (Garfield, Meier, Rosewater, etc.)
- Offer feedback on mechanics, balance, loops, and UX
- Integrate with dev docs, whitepapers, and curriculum
- Shareable outputs for social and educational virality

## Project Structure
- `main.py` — FastAPI entrypoint
- `designers/` — Persona modules for each designer
- `core/` — Core logic for conversation and critique

## Getting Started
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the API: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Next Steps
- Implement designer personas
- Build core conversation logic
- Add endpoints for critique and persona switching
