# TLAGD+ — Think Like a Game Developer Plus (Glitter Cloud Solutions)

A set of AI-powered tools and agents to help founders, product managers, and creative teams turn raw ideas into fundable MVPs, pitch-ready artifacts, and actionable plans—all mapped to business goals and OKRs. TLAGD+ is built for ruthless clarity, rapid iteration, and team alignment.

## Vision
- Prepare builders to succeed in the new world of small, fast teams
- Map every feature, scope, and artifact to explicit business goals and OKRs
- Join meetings and cycles to keep teams focused, accountable, and moving fast
- Deliver agent-referenced, editorialized recommendations for every decision
- Empower teams to go from idea to MVP in days, not months

## Core Features
- Idea ingestion (free-form, doc, or voice)
- AI GDD/PRD builder and ruthless MVP scoping
- Pitch artifact generator (one-pager, deck, exportable)
- Persona/founder feedback mode (legendary dev voices)
- Meeting & Cycle Management Agent (joins meetings, tracks OKRs, editorializes summaries)
- Export to PDF, Notion, Google Slides, and more
- Iterative, chat-based refinement and feedback

## Project Structure
- `main.py` — FastAPI entrypoint and API endpoints
- `designers/` — Persona modules for each legendary voice
- `core/` — Core logic for conversation, critique, and meeting management
- `UX_WIREFRAMES.md` — Wireframes and user experience documentation

## Getting Started
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the API: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Next Steps
- Expand endpoints for meeting/cycle management, OKR focus, and editorialized summaries
